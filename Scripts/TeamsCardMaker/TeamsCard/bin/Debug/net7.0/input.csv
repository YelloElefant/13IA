Westlake Boys High School,"Westlake Boys High School is a state school for boys located on Auckland’s North Shore. It has a distinguished academic record throughout its history and now matched with a sports, arts and music pedigree to be the envy of many of its rivals. Sport is now a large component of the curriculum, with a number of premier sports having achieved enormous success on the national stage in recent years. Rugby union has long been a strength in the North Harbour region, but developments have catapulted the sport into more of a focus on the wider Auckland scene. Winning the North Harbour 1A competition 17 times in the region’s 38-year history motivates the school to continuously search for improvement outside its boundaries. The School now has several teams playing in the Auckland competition, the under 15 side included, which has seen the standard of Westlake Rugby improve significantly over the last few years. In 2022, Westlake Boys High School beat Kelston Boys High School to reach the national Top 4 for the first time – just one week after the under 15 team achieved a best-ever second place finish in this prestigious Under 15 Invitational Tournament.  Westlake has produced 5 All Blacks: Frano Botica, Ron Williams, Dean Kenny, Nick Evans and Luke McAllister. Other international representatives have been Michael Harris, who won selection into the Australian Wallabies and Taione Vea, who has represented his native Tonga.

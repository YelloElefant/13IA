It has a distinguished academic record throughout its history and now matched with a sports arts and music pedigree to be the envy of many of its rivals.  Sport is now a large component of the curriculum with a number of premier sports having achieved enormous success on the national stage in recent years. Rugby union has long been a strength in the North Harbour region but developments have catapulted the sport into more of a focus on the wider Auckland scene. Winning the North Harbour 1A competition 17 times in the region’s 38-year history motivates the school to continuously search for improvement outside its boundaries. The School now has several teams playing in the Auckland competition the under 15 side included which has seen the standard of Westlake Rugby improve significantly over the last few years. In 2022 Westlake Boys High School beat Kelston Boys High School to reach the national Top 4 for the first time – just one week after the under 15 team achieved a best-ever second place finish in this prestigious Under 15 Invitational Tournament.

Hastings Boys High School,"Hastings Boys' High School was originally founded in 1904. Originally titled the Hastings Borough School it became the Hastings District High School with Mr L.F. Pegler appointed Headmaster. In 1956 Hastings District School split to become Hastings Boys' and Hastings Girls' High Schools. The 2017 Rugby season was the most successful in the school's history with the 1st XV winning the Barbarians National 1st XV title. Six of that team were selected in the New Zealand Secondary Schools rugby team. Devan Flanders then went on to play a pivotal role for New Zealand at rugby's under-20 World Championship in France. In 2018 the 1st XV competed in and were runners up in the Sannix World Youth Rugby Tournament in Fukuoka Japan.  The 2019 season saw the 1st XV win their second Barbarians National    1st XV title but due to COVID they were unable to compete at the 2020 Sannix World Youth Tournament. 2019 also saw our U15 team win the National U15 Tournament for the second time in the school’s history.  Due to COVID affecting the 2020 tournament our U15 team played in and won the Hawkes Bay Division 1 final for the first time in the competitions history against other local 1st XV teams. They also hosted and won an U15 Super 8 invitational tournament held in Hastings in 2020.With the foundations of the school rugby programme built around the Junior Academies based on our philosophy of hard work respect and team spirit the school is well placed for future success. The holistic approach to development is paramount at Hastings Boys' to ensure rugby-playing students' aspirations are met in a well-balanced caring environment.
